# Run2Gether

An app that helps users connect with other runners in the area to schedule runs together.  Create an account, update your profile with your goals and experience level, and start searching for runs in your area.

Whether you are a seasoned vetran, competitive, or just getting started, we believe that people go further when they *run together*.
